GameState -> Player -> Board -> Item -> Behavior

behavior sometimes needs:
 * player info
 * board info
 * item info

if I pass the game state to the behavior then I can access all that info
if it is too expensive to find that info, I can optimize.




Goals:

take in a dictionary of your items/skills/backpack and your opponent's board /
skills and then make a positioning solver.

extra's:

simulator that can explain what your best config is and how much total 
damage you can do by a certain timestamp. 
i.e. how much damage can you be 6 sec? 12 sec? 30 sec?
